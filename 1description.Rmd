# Package setup

Every R package needs a DESCRIPTION file, so we start by specifying this information:

```{r package-setup, message=FALSE, results='hide'}
usethis::create_package(
  path = ".",
  fields = list(
    Package = params$package_name,
    Version = "0.0.0.9000",
    Title = "A Package That Does Least Squares",
    Description = "This package does least squares.",
    `Authors@R` = person(
      given = "Jacob",
      family = "Bien",
      email = "jbien@usc.edu",
      role = c("aut", "cre")
      )
  )
)
usethis::use_mit_license(copyright_holder = "J. Bien")
```

You can see that we're using functions from the [usethis](https://usethis.r-lib.org/) package.

Although it's not required, it can be nice to add some package-level documentation.  This is what will show up when someone types `package?<your-package-name>` in the console.

```{package_doc}
#' A Package That Does Least Squares
#'
#' This package does least squares.  But what's actually interesting about it is that it was defined as a `bookdown` using the `litr` package.
#' 
#' @docType package
#' @seealso `do_least_squares`
